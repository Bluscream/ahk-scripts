Enter "3D74QF9", "3GCC7XR", or "N7NN4F9" as a code at the terminal between two garages in front of the police station, and the two garage doors will open.
The one on the left is a Robbery Arrest mission, where you take the Justice car and chase a hoodlum. The one on the right is a Vehicle Stealing mission,
where you use the Spirit red sports car. Successfully complete the bonus missions to unlock the vehicles that were used in the missions.
